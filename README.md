**Automating Data Streaming with Apache Airflow, Kafka, Spark, and Cassandra!**

Docker-Compose Breakdown:

1. Zookeeper: Coordinates Kafka brokers.

2. Kafka Broker: Core message broker, set up with both internal (broker:29092) and external (localhost:9092) connections.

3. Schema Registry: Manages Kafka message schemas for data consistency and evolution.

Kafka Control Center: Web UI for monitoring Kafka.

4. Airflow: Handles task scheduling and workflow automation, using PostgreSQL as a metadata backend.

5. Spark: Processes streaming data from Kafka for real-time transformations.

6. Cassandra: Stores processed data from Spark as a scalable NoSQL database.

Next Steps:

1. Kafka + Spark Integration: Kafka streams real-time data, which is consumed by Spark's Structured Streaming to process data (e.g., users_created topic) and store it in Cassandra.

2. Cassandra + Spark Integration: Use Spark-Cassandra connectors to seamlessly write processed data into Cassandra.

3. Airflow + Spark Integration: Airflow DAGs trigger Spark jobs for data processing after Kafka ingestion tasks.

4. Schema Registry: Enforce Avro/Protobuf schemas for structured Kafka messages, ensuring smooth producer-consumer communication.



This full setup offers fault tolerance, scalability, and real-time analytics, perfect for live data processing use cases like user profiling or scalable streaming architectures.

Key Highlights:

1. Airflow DAG: Automates daily data collection via API, streams formatted data to Kafka topics.

2. Kafka Streaming: Simulates real-time user data ingestion.

3. Spark Structured Streaming: Transforms and maps data to schemas for downstream processes.

4. Cassandra: Efficiently stores and retrieves processed data from Spark.
   

This end-to-end pipeline is ideal for automating workflows, handling real-time data ingestion, and enabling robust data analytics.
